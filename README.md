Junior Programmer Pathway Unit 1 - Player Control submission (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Easy: Obstacle Pyramids
Create stacks, piles, or pyramids of obstacles for the vehicle to drive through.
These will be more satisfying for the player to crash into compared with single objects.



- Medium: Oncoming vehicles
Add a couple of other cars that are automatically driving down the road in the opposite direction, which the player also has to avoid. 
This will make the experience much more challenging, since the player will now be forced to think quickly, rather than taking as much time as they need.


- Hard: Camera switcher
Allow the player to press a key on the keyboard to switch camera views.
Ideally, the same key would toggle between two views, one above and behind the vehicle, and the other from the perspective of the driverâ€™s seat.
